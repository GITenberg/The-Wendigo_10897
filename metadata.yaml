description: Algernon Blackwood's "The Wendigo" tells the story of a camping trip
  in the Canadian wilderness that goes horribly wrong when the hunters become the
  hunted. Drawing on the mythical creature known as the Wendigo, this story is regarded
  by many critics to be one of the best horror tales of all time.
